    "summary": "Knowing how models like Claude *think* would allow us to have a better understanding of their abilities, as well as help us ensure that they’re doing what we intend them to. In the first paper, we extend our prior work locating interpretable concepts (\"features\") inside a model to link those concepts together into computational \"circuits\", revealing parts of the pathway that transforms the words that go into Claude into the words that come out. Recently-released models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet can",

    "summary": "Nevertheless, these findings challenge some common intuitions about what language models are capable of—and since we found that the most capable models we tested (Claude Opus 4 and 4.1) performed the best on our tests of introspection, we think it’s likely that AI models’ introspective capabilities will continue to grow more sophisticated in the future. In order to test whether a model can introspect, we need to compare the model’s self-reported “thoughts” to its *actual* internal states. In ano",
