  <div class="title">[1] Tracing the thoughts of a large language model - Anthropic</div>
  <div class="summary">Knowing how models like Claude *think* would allow us to have a better understanding of their abilities, as well as help us ensure that they’re doing what we intend them to. In the first paper, we extend our prior work locating interpretable concepts ("features") inside a model to link those concepts together into computational "circuits", revealing parts of the pathway that transforms the words that go into Claude into the words that come out. Recently-released models like Claude 3</div>

  <div class="title">[2] Signs of introspection in large language models - Anthropic</div>
  <div class="summary">Nevertheless, these findings challenge some common intuitions about what language models are capable of—and since we found that the most capable models we tested (Claude Opus 4 and 4. 1) performed the best on our tests of introspection, we think it’s likely that AI models’ introspective capabilities will continue to grow more sophisticated in the future. In order to test whether a model can introspect, we need to compare the model’s self-reported “thoughts” to its *actual* internal states</div>

  <div class="summary">The TruDi system isn’t the only one to come under question: The FDA has received reports involving dozens of other AI-enhanced devices, including a heart monitor said to have overlooked abnormal heartbeats and an ultrasound device that allegedly misidentified fetal body parts. In 2021, Acclarent’s president at the time, Jeff Hopkins, was pushing to put AI in TruDi “as a marketing tool” to claim that the device “had new and novel technology,” Fernihough’s suit alleges. Reuters found that at least 1,401 of the reports filed to the FDA between 2021 and October 2025 concern medical devices that are on an FDA list of 1,357 products that use AI</div>
